Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. A web framework provides a structure and starting point for creating your application, allowing you to focus on creating something amazing while we sweat the details.

Laravel strives to provide an amazing developer experience while providing powerful features such as thorough dependency injection, an expressive database abstraction layer, queues and scheduled jobs, unit and integration testing, and more.

Whether you are new to PHP web frameworks or have years of experience, Laravel is a framework that can grow with you. We'll help you take your first steps as a web developer or give you a boost as you take your expertise to the next level. We can't wait to see what you build.





Before creating your first Laravel project, you should ensure that your local machine has PHP and Composer installed. If you are developing on macOS, PHP and Composer can be installed via Homebrew. In addition, we recommend installing Node and NPM.

After you have installed PHP and Composer, you may create a new Laravel project via the Composer create-project command:

composer create-project laravel/laravel example-app

Or, you may create new Laravel projects by globally installing the Laravel installer via Composer:

composer global require laravel/installer
 
laravel new example-app

After the project has been created, start Laravel's local development server using the Laravel's Artisan CLI serve command:

cd example-app
 
php artisan serve
